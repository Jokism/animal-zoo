            The salamander, (order Caudata), any member of a group of about 740 species 
            of amphibians that have tails and that constitute the order Caudata. The order 
            comprises 10 families, among which are newts and salamanders proper (family 
            Salamandridae) as well as hellbenders, mud puppies, and lungless salamanders. 
            They most commonly occur in freshwater and damp woodlands, principally in 
            temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.

            Salamanders are generally short-bodied, four-legged, moist-skinned animals, 
            about <em>10</em> to <em>15</em> cm (<em>4</em> to <em>6</em> inches) long. 
            Many are camouflaged, whereas others are boldly patterned or brightly coloured. 
            The largest members of the order are the Chinese giant salamanders—Andrias sligoi 
            can grow to <em>2</em> meters (<em>6.6</em> feet), and A. davidianus can grow to 
            <em>1.8</em> meters (<em>5.9</em> feet) in length—and the Japanese giant salamander 
            (A. japonicus), which can grow up to <em>1.7</em> meters (<em>5.6</em> feet) in length.

            Salamanders feed on insects, worms, snails, and other small animals, including members of 
            their own species. Like other amphibians, they absorb water through their skin, and they 
            require a moist habitat. In regions where the temperature goes below freezing, they often 
            hibernate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most adult salamanders hide by day and feed by night. Some remain hidden underground until 
            the breeding season, or they may emerge only when levels of moisture and temperature are 
            appropriate. Many species, especially in the family Plethodontidae, are strictly terrestrial 
            and avoid ponds and streams.
