            The ferret is either of two species in the carnivore family Mustelidae. 
            The common ferret (Mustela putorius furo) is a domesticated form of the 
            European polecat. It has a long, lithe body and is brown, black, or 
            white (albino). Its average length is <em>20</em> in. (<em>51</em> cm), 
            including the <em>5</em>-in. (<em>13</em>-cm) tail, and it weighs about 
            <em>2</em> lbs (<em>1</em> kg). It was originally domesticated for hunting 
            mice, rats, and rabbits. Today ferrets are commonly kept as pets. The 
            black-footed ferret (M. nigripes), of the North American plains, has a black 
            mask across the eyes and brownish black markings on the feet and tail tip. 
            It is an endangered species, owing to the loss of its main source of food, 
            the prairie dog.
