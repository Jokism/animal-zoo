        <p>The cat, (Felis catus), also called house cat or domestic cat, domesticated member 
            of the family Felidae, order Carnivora, and the smallest member of that family. 
            Like all felids, domestic cats are characterized by supple low-slung bodies, 
            finely molded heads, long tails that aid in balance, and specialized teeth and claws 
            that adapt them admirably to a life of active hunting. Cats possess other features of 
            their wild relatives in being basically carnivorous, remarkably agile and powerful, 
            and finely coordinated in movement.
        </p>
        <p>The average weight of the household cat varies from <em>2.7</em> to <em>4.5</em> kg 
            (<em>6</em> to <em>10</em> pounds), although, among nonpedigreed cats, weights up to 
            <em>12.7</em> kg (<em>28</em> pounds) are not uncommon. Average lengths are <em>71.1</em> 
            cm (<em>28</em> inches) for males and <em>50.8</em> cm (<em>20</em> inches) for females. 
            In keeping with a carnivorous habit, the cat has a simple gut; the small intestine is only 
            about three times the length of the body. The skin of the cat, composed of dermis and epidermis, 
            regenerates and fights off infection quickly. Tiny erector muscles, attached to hair follicles, 
            enable the cat to bristle all over. Thus, although the cat is a relatively small animal, it can 
            frighten enemies by arching its back, bristling, and hissing.

        <p>The number of recognized show breeds that have defined, inherited characteristics has increased 
            dramatically since the late 1950s as cats have become more popular as home companions. The 30 to 
            40 distinctive breeds can be grouped into two general categories: the long-haired Persian and the 
            domestic shorthair. Both of these breeds occur in various subcategories based on their coat colour, 
            such as white, cream, chinchilla (or silver), smoke, tortoiseshell, and tabby (red, blue, and so on). 
            Other distinctive and popular breeds include the Siamese (with seal point, blue point, chocolate point, 
            and lilac point colour variations), the long-haired Himalayan, which resembles the Siamese in coloration, 
            and the Abyssinian, Burmese, Manx, Rex, and Russian Blue.
