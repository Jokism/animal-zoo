        <h1>Koala</h1>
        <img src="../img/koala.gif" alt="koala">
        <p>The koala is a tree-dwelling marsupial (Phascolarctos cinereus) of coastal eastern Australia. 
            About <em>24–33</em> in. (<em>61–85</em> cm) long and tailless, the koala has a stout, pale gray or yellowish body,
            broad face, a big round leathery nose, small yellow eyes, and fluffy ears. Its feet have strong claws 
            and some opposable digits. The koala feeds only on <em>eucalyptus leaves</em>.
            The single offspring remains in the rearward-opening pouch for up to seven months. Koala populations have 
            dwindled seriously, formerly because they were killed for their fur and now because of loss of habitat and 
            the spread of disease.
